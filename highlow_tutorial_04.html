	Tasks:
		1. Try to work through this nearly complete example, it introduces the following new functions:
		return: this can be used to pass information back to the calling instructon
		if: this can be used to test a condition and if true it will execute a dependent bit of code
		else: this can be used to execute a different bit of dependent code if the condition being tested was false
		confirm: this uses the a built-in message box (similar to alert) but includes two buttons

			function fnRandomNumber(max) {
				//this function (a collection of instructions) create a random number
				var number; //declare a variable called 'number' and dont assign it to any value yet
				number = Math.random() * max; //this line executes the random function and scales it up based on the max value
				number = Math.floor(number); //this line executes the floor function essentially rounds down a floating point number into an interger (whole number)
				return number; //this causes the function to pass a value back to the line that called it
			}

			function fnHighLow() {
				//try to work out exactly what this function does and how
				
				var number1=fnRandomNumber(100); //call the fnRandomNumber function (passing it the value of 100), then store the return value in the variable called number1
				var number2=fnRandomNumber(100); //call the fnRandomNumber function (passing it the value of 100), then store the return value in the variable called number1

				//this next section calls the JavaScript confirm box (a message box with two buttons, okay and cancel), we can use those to get information from the users
				higher=confirm("The first number is: " + number1 + " click okay if you think the second number will be higher")

				} else {
					//false, the user did not click the okay button (they must have clicked cancel instead), so execute these dependent instructions
					alert("You think the number will be lower");
