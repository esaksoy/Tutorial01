	Tasks:
		1. Try to work through this mostly complete example
		2. It builds on the instructions already used and introduces a global variable, global variables are variables that can be accessed and used anywhere in your program (these can be good and bad, we will discuss them later in the module)
		3. Use the global variable to keep a score, 10 points should be added for each right answer, -10 should be deducted for each wrong answer
		4. If not already resolved try to identify and resolve the problem regarding if the numbers are the same
		5. Once you have solved the score task, try to enhance your program so that if a user has: 
			a. More than 100 points they get a "You have scored more than 100, excellent work" message
			b. Less than 40 points they get a "You are terrible at this" message
