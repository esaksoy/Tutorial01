	Tasks:
		1. Review the change to the fnRandomNumber function
		2. Change the range of the random number so that it is between 0 and 100 and test it.
		3. Review the links provided so that you will be able to find a good source of information about JavaScript librarie in the future; this time the function is given (passed) information, this is a very powerful technique in programming
		4. Fix the program so that the calling event passes the correct max value
