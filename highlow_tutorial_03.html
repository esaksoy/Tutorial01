	Tasks:
		1. Review the program and consider how to update the program so that the alert message reads "The first random number was:" instead of "The random number was: "
		2. Test your change and fix any errors that may have been introduced

		PS - Don't forget JavaScript is case sensitive, use the console to get details on any errors; this may be a bit like error rage
