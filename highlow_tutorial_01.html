	This is a comment section and is ignored by the browser, comments are great as they allow programmers to 
	add alsorts of helpful information about what their program is doing and why.  For example this program uses
	two JavaScript functions the its Math library these are:
		1. Math.random()
		random is a function that returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0–1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that range — which you can then scale to your desired range, see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random

		2. Math.floor(number)
		floor is a function that returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor

	Tasks:
		1. Get this program running in Chrome and test it.
		2. Change the range of the random number so that it is between 0 and 100 and test it.
		3. Review the links provided so that you will be able to find a good source of information about JavaScript librarie in the future

				var number; //declare a variable called 'number' and dont assign it to any value yet
				number = Math.random() * max; //this line executes the random function and scales it up based on the max value
				number = Math.floor(number); //this line executes the floor function essentially rounds down a floating point number into an interger (whole number)
				alert("The random number was: " + number); //this executes JavaScripts alert box and populates it with the message
